					<li data-theme="b">How do women play a role in the play?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">In the play women play much more of a role than they actually do in history for the time period of the play.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The two female protagonists, Lear's daughters Regan and Goneril, are deceiving, violent, and power hungry, perhaps even more so than any man portrayed in the play.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Meanwhile Lear's third daughter Cordelia, is most typical of Shakespearean women as she is very loyal, selfless, and good-willed.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">These three female characters seem to be the driving force in the play as their actions, and desires fuel the plot.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The two female antagonists even prove that they can kill with the best of the men, as Regan even uses a sword to kill, which is typically reserved as something that only a man would partake in.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The role these women play seems to stem from the lack of a female character in any of their lives to guide them as their mother is long dead when the play begins.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Without a mother they are essentially raised by men, and do not have the guidance to develop into normal women for the setting.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">In your opinion what do you believe is symbolized by the storm in Act 3?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">One could see the storm as representing the strongly developing chaos in King Lear's mind.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Over the course of the play the results of King Lear's actions seem to be driving him mad and he is slowly being lost in the chaos of his mind, the swirling mess that is filling his head is just like the brewing storm ready to lay waste on the land below it.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The storm also seems to show that despite Lear's position as king and his elevated status among the common man, he is still mortal and even nature can get the best of him.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">In Shakespeare's plays divine justice often plays a key role and it seems as if the storm could also be an act of divine justice handed down by the gods.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">This divine justice could be directed towards the warring factions in Lear's land as punishment for their actions, and it also could serve as punishment to Lear for his initial treatment of Cordelia.</li>
